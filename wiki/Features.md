|Red   |Hot Topic      |Articles which have many votes and are active.                                  |
|Orange|Controversial  |Articles which have many opposing votes.                                        |
|Yellow|Not Passionate |Articles which do not have passionate voters from either side.                  |
|Green |Decided        |Articles which, for the most part, have been completely determined to be biased.|
|Blue  |One-Sided      |Articles which only have votes from one side of the spectrum.                   |
|Purple|You Decide     |Articles which do not have many votes from either side.                         |
